# INTRODUCTION: 
Welcome to my capstone project on Spain Macroeconomics View (2004-2018), that is part of specialization Globalization, Economic Growth and Stability Specialization course - 2 (Two) Trade, Immigration and Exchange Rates in a Globalized world.

# TASK: 
 https://www.coursera.org/learn/trade-immigration-exchange-rates-globalized-world/peer/JZje8/final-presentation-peer-graded 
In this peer graded I will have to analyse Spain for the period 2004-2018.
The next step after studying all the information, is to divide the information in two periods:
  + 2004-2012
  + 2013-2018

Now, taking this in consideration, I will have to answer the following questions:

##### 1- Compare investment and savings (expressed as a percent of GDP).
+ A)	What do you see?
+ B)	Based on what you learned in this course, what would you expect the current account balance to look like in Spain in the 2004-2012? And in the 2013-2018 period?     
##### 2- Compare your predictions with the current account balance figures you have downloaded for these two periods.

##### 3- What are the differences in the risk profile of Spain between these two periods?

##### 4- Spain during this period had exchanged its own currency for the euro. If instead it had had its own currency, and all other things remaining equal, what might the trends in the currency´s value have been in the 2004-2012 period? In the 2013-2018 period?

##### 5- If the government had wanted to return the country´s current account to balance, what would have been the right policies for it to follow in 2004-2012? In 2013-2018?

##### 6- Has anything changed in Spain´s balance of payments profile since 2018?


# DATA: 
The data is available on the website( www.imf.org ) I can find the latest data from the IMF´s World Economic Outlook, another valuable data source. Go to this page and select Data, and then World Economic Outlook Databases( the link at the time of publication is http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/index.aspx ).Choose Spain for the period 2004-2018. For variables, select the following: 

+ Total investment (percent of GDP) 
+ Gross national savings (percent of GDP) 
+ Current account balance (percent of GDP)

# ANALYZE STEP:
Let’s Analyse the Macroeconomic situation of Spain during the year between 2004- 2018 by giving answers above the following questions: 
# QUESTION: 1
Compare investment and savings (expressed as a percent of GDP).
A)	What do you see?
B)	Based on what you learned in this course, what would you expect the current account balance to look like in Spain in the 2004-2012? And in the 2013-2018 period?     

### Answer: - Let’s view the Investment and Savings Data of Spain (2004-2018) from the data is available in the below link on IMF website 
( https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2018/October/weo-report?c=184,&s=NID_NGDP,NGSD_NGDP,&sy=2004&ey=2018&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 )

## I will represent this data on the line graph to get clear view

### ANSWER: - A) According to above data and the graph that I have created showed that the Spain had been going through two kinds of account balance, which is deficit and surplus. From 2004 to 2018 investment has decreased and saving decreased too, but until 2011, after that government started savings in order to avoid deficit. 
### ANSWER: - B) Spain (2004-2008) 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90096554/142666440-c26e45d0-b8d6-48d7-9e1a-6666e9db3b56.png)

According to data and graph shows that the Spain was under the current account deficit. Because the total investment was greater than the savings, government was spending more than the saving, or it’s consuming more than they are producing. 
	
### SPAIN (20013-2018)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90096554/142666673-f7a3197d-a71b-4ace-b540-0ec17a599c50.png)

In the second period of Spain from 2013 to 2018, above the Data and graph shows that the total savings was greater than the investment. That would be mean, that they are saving more then that they are able to spend or that they are producing more than the consuming.
## QUESTION: - 2)
Compare your predictions with the current account balance figures you have downloaded for these two periods. Does it match what you have expected? Why?

## ANSWER: - 
Let’s look at the Current Account Balance Data whether my prediction is match or not. The data is available in the below link on IMF website ( https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2018/October/weo-report?c=184,&s=BCA_NGDPD,&sy=2004&ey=2018&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 )

I will make a bar graph with the above data to get clear view whether my prediction was match or not.

Yes, it matches with my prediction. Above the data and graph shows that during the period of SPAIN 2004-2012, the country was going through current account deficit. Even the country was in the largest inflationary gap and the country had a very large current account Deficit 10% of the GDP, which is the world largest in the world 2004-2008. And even in the period of 2013-2018, I have predicted that this situation would lead to current account surplus. And that surplus that reached a maximum of 2% of the GDP and continue over the entire period 2016 on it was around two percentage GDP.

## QUESTION: - 3) 
What are the differences in the risk profile of Spain between these two periods 2004-2012 and 2013 to 2018? 
Types of risk: - Currency, Demand, International borrowing of Lending and Exposure to creditworthiness of other countries

### ANSWER: - I will differentiate in a table so, we can get clear view.

## QUESTION: - 4)
Spain during this period had exchanged its own currency for the euro. If instead it had had its own currency, and all other things remaining equal, what might the trends in the currency´s value have been in the 2004-2012 period? In the 2013-2018 period?

### ANSWER: -
Assuming all other things were equal: -
Spain in the period 2004-2012, country had a deficit account balance. Currency value would drop.
And the period between 2013 to 2018 Spain had surplus account balance/trend was improving, Currency value was stronger and increasing during this period.

## QUESTION: - 5)
If the government had wanted to return the country´s current account to balance, what would have been the right policies for it to follow in 2004-2012? In 2013-2018?

### ANSWER: - Spain was going through deficit account balance from the period between 2004-2012 and If the government had wanted to get rid of the current account deficit, it would have to reduce absorption; it would have to reduce domestic consumption of GDP. Now GDP is consumed domestically through consumers, investors and government. So, somehow, the government would have had to get people spend less or spend less itself, or it would have to encourage investors to somehow to spend less. 

Spain’s account balance was surplus during the period between 2013-2018 and government to get rid of. So, the government would have to get absorption to rise. In other words, it would have to do things to stimulate consumption, investment and government spending. So, that country was able to consume more of its own output and close that gap between what its consumers which is less.

## QUESTION: - 6)
Has anything changed in Spain´s balance of payments profile since 2018?

### ANSWER: - Let’s see the data whether anything has changed in Spain’s balance of payment since 2018. The data is available in the below link on IMF website 
( https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October/weo-report?c=184,&s=BCA_NGDPD,&sy=2018&ey=2021&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 )

Yes, there has some changes happened in the balance of payments as the based till year 2021. According to the Data above from the IMF website it shows that, In the year 2019 current account has increased to 2.136 from 1.93 in 2018, it’s means surplus increased and fell down again in the year 2021 to 0.413. But still Spain has current account surplus. 

## CONCLUSION:  - 
It is fascinating to find that a country (Spain) with two different profiles in a period of 20 years. The period between 2004-2012, country was going through current account deficit and in another period between 2013-2018, country was going through current account surplus.
